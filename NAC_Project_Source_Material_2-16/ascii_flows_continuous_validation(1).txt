ASCII FLOWS: Continuous Validation (Post‑Admission Drift/Threat)

Legend
- PDP: Policy Decision Point (Forescout platform)
- PEP: Policy Enforcement Point (switch/WLC/firewall/SDN)
- CoA: RADIUS Change of Authorization
- TI: Threat Intelligence (Vedere Labs, CISA KEV, vendor advisories)
- DPL: Forescout Device Profile Library

------------------------------------------------------------
Flow D — IoT Continuous Validation (Posture & Threat Drift)

[Signals]
  - Device drift (agent health: EDR/MDM/Vuln agent offline; heartbeat loss)
  - DHCP/IP change anomalies; rogue services detected
  - TI updates: KEV flag for device model/firmware; Vedere Labs indicators
        |
        v
[Forescout PDP]
  - Re-evaluate device record (DPL classification, last policy state, risk)
  - Decide: {no change | restrict role | quarantine | isolate}
        |
        +--> [Access Switch/PEP]: CoA -> change dACL/VLAN/SGT to restricted
        +--> [WLC/PEP]: CoA -> downgrade WLAN role/VLAN (wireless IoT)
        +--> [Firewall/SDN]*: tag-based policy tighten (optional)
        +--> [Notify/Ticket]: create case; optional user/ops alert

Auto-restore: when signals recover (agent healthy; KEV mitigated), PDP issues CoA to revert to least-privilege role. All state changes logged.

------------------------------------------------------------
Flow E — OT Continuous Validation (Anomaly & Threat‑Intel Driven)

[Signals]
  - eyeInspect passive detections: new peer, unexpected protocol/function codes,
    rate/volume anomaly, write to controller where read-only expected
  - TI updates: Vedere Labs indicator; KEV on PLC/HMI firmware family
        |
        v
[Forescout PDP]
  - Map affected asset(s) to IEC‑62443 Zone and Conduits
  - Decide zone-level action: {monitor only | tighten conduit | quarantine cell}
        |
        +--> [OT Firewall/PEP]: update allow-list (conduit) or block new peers
        +--> [Switch/PEP]: move to OT observation VLAN (if used)
        +--> [Access Broker]: deny vendor sessions to affected zone(s)
        +--> [Ops Runbook]: notify control room / MOC process, capture evidence

Exit: After triage/remediation, rollback conduit changes; keep audit trail and lessons learned.

------------------------------------------------------------
Flow F — Engineering / Vendor Workstation Continuous Validation

[Access Broker]
  - Enforces time-bound access; pre-checks device posture (MFA, EDR, patch age)
        |
        v
[Active Session]
  - Streaming posture events: EDR tamper on, sensor offline, policy drift
        |
        v
[Forescout PDP]
  - Action: revoke session via Access Broker; PEPs deny flows to target zone
  - Optional: place workstation in remediation role on campus/WLAN via CoA
  - Notify vendor and site owner; require re-attestation before re-entry

------------------------------------------------------------
Flow G — Global TI/KEV Hot‑Patch Pipeline (Fleet Response)

[TI Feeds] → (Vedere Labs, CISA KEV)
        |
        v
[Forescout PDP / Inventory]
  - Correlate impacted device types/firmware across IoT/OT inventory
  - Rank by criticality and exposure; propose actions per site
        |
        +--> [Change Window]: generate staged policies (monitor → enforce)
        +--> [PEPs]: apply conduit tighten/role downgrade across targets
        +--> [Ops]: coordinate vendor patch/compensating controls

------------------------------------------------------------
Flow H — Incident Closure & Auto‑Restore

[Criteria Met]
  - Patch applied; configuration validated; anomalies cleared; posture healthy
        |
        v
[Forescout PDP]
  - Issue CoA / policy rollback to least‑privilege; close ticket with evidence
  - Update knowledge base (policy patterns, exceptions, maintenance notes)

Notes
- Enforcement is always executed on PEPs (switch/WLC/firewall/SDN); Forescout
  orchestrates decisions and maintains auditability.
- OT remains passive-first; changes prefer conduit adjustments over shutdowns.
- All flows support staged rollout: Monitor → Alert → Enforce with rollback.
