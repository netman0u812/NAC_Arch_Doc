Zero Trust–Aligned NAC Architecture

1) Purpose & Scope (Executive Overview) This architecture establishes a
Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) control layer that only permits trusted
users on compliant, trusted devices to access internal and third‑party
(3PLZ) resources. It uses Forescout for device discovery, posture
assessment, and connect‑time enforcement across heterogeneous networks;
Cisco ISE for wireless authentication/authorization; Intune/Jamf for
device compliance; CrowdStrike Falcon for endpoint protection and
telemetry; and an application‑layer mTLS pattern for tenant proxies. The
design aligns with NIST SP 800‑207 tenets (continuous verification,
least privilege, telemetry‑driven policy). 

2) Outcomes Mapped to Slide Columns

The bullets below mirror the “Forescout NAC Platform” row in your slide
and expand each outcome into deployable controls.

Devices — Posture Check; Compliant‑Only Access

Continuous device discovery & classification of managed/unmanaged
endpoints (Windows, macOS, IoT/OT) to eliminate blind spots.

Connect‑time posture gates (wired & wireless):

Forescout SecureConnector installed/healthy
MDM enrollment & compliance (Intune/Jamf)
Valid machine certificate + AD join
CrowdStrike Falcon installed/healthy; signature age/score thresholds
Qualys Cloud Agent installed & service running (presence/health only)
Devices failing any gate remain L3‑restricted until remediated. 

Network — Enforce Access at Connect Time

Wired (no 802.1X; no holding VLAN): Forescout applies/removes per‑port
L3 ACLs (or downloadable ACLs) via SNMP/REST to keep devices in
restricted L3 until posture verified, then promotes to the tenant
policy.

Wireless (802.1X with Cisco ISE): ISE performs EAP
auth; Forescout shares posture and can signal ISE via pxGrid/ANC to
change authorization (roles/SGTs/dACLs) on posture drift.

Visibility & Analytics — Device Discovery; Network Visibility

Unified inventory and posture telemetry exported to SIEM; integration
with ISE (pxGrid) provides shared context and adaptive enforcement.


3) Policy (Managed Workstations) Scope: Windows & macOS corporate
workstations (wired or wireless). Connect‑time Decision (Allow to Full
Access vs. Keep Restricted L3): A device receives full network access
only if all checks pass:

Forescout SecureConnector present, healthy. [digisoc.net] MDM compliance
(Intune or Jamf Pro). [blog.admindroid.com], [learn.jamf.com] Machine
certificate valid (issuer/EKU/expiry) and AD domain join verified.
[digisoc.net] CrowdStrike Falcon sensor installed/healthy; signature age
and policy score meet threshold. [falconpy.io] Qualys Cloud Agent
installed; service running (presence/health only—no scan freshness
gate). [digisoc.net]

Post‑admission Continuous Controls (No hold VLAN required):

On posture drift (agent disabled, MDM non‑compliant, expired cert, EDR
unhealthy), re‑apply restricted L3 via Forescout; for wireless, use
pxGrid/ANC to downgrade authorization dynamically. [digisoc.net],
[docs.forescout.com] Optional risk overlays (if you choose to use them):

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) device‑risk &
remediation tasks via Intune. [blog.intunepckgr.com] CrowdStrike Falcon
Spotlight (scanless vuln posture) for prioritization and evidence, if
licensed. [documentat...uronix.com]




4) Policy (Profiled IoT / Non‑Supplicant, MAB‑based) Identity &
Profiling: MAC as client ID + Forescout signatures (OUI, DHCP/LLDP
fingerprints, protocol heuristics) to determine device type and expected
behavior. Devices start L3‑restricted; promotion to minimal allow‑lists
only after classification. [digisoc.net] Enforcement: Per‑port L3
ACLs/dACLs; for WLAN IoT, use ISE MAB with profiles and SGT‑based
policies; Forescout can apply ANC/SGT via pxGrid when classification or
risk changes. [docs.forescout.com]

5) Reference Architecture (High‑Level)

Connect (Wired/WLAN):

Wired: default restricted L3; Wireless: ISE 802.1X authZ pending.
[digisoc.net], [docs.forescout.com]


Assess: Forescout evaluates agent/MDM/cert/AD/EDR/Qualys service; ISE
shares auth context via pxGrid. [digisoc.net], [docs.forescout.com]
Decide & Enforce:

Pass → lift L3 restrictions (wired) or return ISE role/SGT/dACL
(wireless). Fail → remain restricted L3 with access only to
DNS/DHCP/IdP/MDM/EDR/Qualys management endpoints. [digisoc.net]


Operate: Continuous posture monitoring; on drift, downgrade via L3 ACLs
(wired) or ANC/SGT (wireless). [docs.forescout.com] Observe: Export
device & posture telemetry to SIEM; optionally incorporate
MDVM/Spotlight insights for analytics and prioritization.

7) Network Requirements (Fit for Legacy Constraints)

Switch capabilities: SNMP/REST write to apply/remove per‑port L3 ACLs;
LLDP/CDP for mapping; DHCP snooping/IP‑MAC binding recommended.
[digisoc.net] Wireless: ISE with 802.1X; pxGrid enabled; ANC policies
defined for quarantine/restricted roles and SGTs. [community.cisco.com]
Restricted L3 baseline ACLs available at every access layer, permitting
only identity, management, and remediation services (IdP, DNS/DHCP/NTP,
MDM, EDR, Qualys agent backends, Forescout). [digisoc.net]

9) Phased Implementation Plan Phase 0 – Foundations (2–4 wks)

Enable Forescout discovery on target segments; validate switch control
profiles. Integrate Intune/Jamf for compliance; connect Falcon APIs;
install pxGrid plugin; define ANC policies in ISE. [digisoc.net],
[learn.jamf.com], [docs.forescout.com]

Phase 1 – Connect‑Time Enforcement (4–6 wks)

Enforce restricted L3 by default on wired; lift upon passing posture
gates (including Qualys service). WLAN remains under ISE; validate
posture‑driven role changes via pxGrid. [digisoc.net],
[docs.forescout.com]

Phase 2 – Posture Drift Automation (3–5 wks)

Add continuous checks; on drift, auto‑downgrade via ACL/ANC; alert +
ticket. (Optional) Ingest MDVM or Spotlight risk to drive targeted
remediation flows. [blog.intunepckgr.com], [documentat...uronix.com]

Phase 3 – IoT / MAB Enforcement (3–6 wks)

Roll out profiling signatures; build per‑type allow‑lists; bind to
SGT/dACL policies for WLAN IoT. [digisoc.net]
