1. What the Forescout workstation agent and Forescout appliances do (Technical Explanation)

Forescout’s platform is built around device visibility, posture assessment, and network access enforcement—without requiring agents everywhere. However, where used, the Forescout workstation agent (SecureConnector) and the Forescout appliances perform distinct roles:

---
A. **Forescout Workstation Agent (SecureConnector)**
- Provides continuous endpoint posture assessment.
- Collects identity, OS, patch level, security tool status, certificates, and other telemetry.
- Communicates posture attributes back to the Forescout appliance.
- Receives instructions to trigger local actions (e.g., pop-up notifications, endpoint-based remediation tasks).
- Enhances visibility when switches/routers cannot provide sufficient metadata.
- Optional component—Forescout remains largely agentless.

---
B. **Forescout Appliances (CounterACT, eyeInspect, eyeSight, eyeControl, etc.)**
- Perform real-time network monitoring using switch, wireless controller, DHCP, SNMP, NetFlow/IPFIX, and traffic analysis.
- Classify devices using multi-factor profiling heuristics.
- Store and evaluate device posture data against policy.
- Trigger enforcement actions via network infrastructure (switch ports, firewalls, VPN, SDN controllers, etc.).
- Act as the policy decision point (PDP) and policy engine.
- Do *not* directly block traffic; they orchestrate enforcement via integrations.

Forescout appliances therefore serve as a centralized orchestration and enforcement brain, while the workstation agent is an optional telemetry augmenter.

2. Enforcement Methods Available to Forescout (Technical Perspective)

It's critical to emphasize: **Forescout is an orchestration and decision engine; the actual enforcement occurs on the network infrastructure—primarily the switches.**

Forescout supports the following enforcement mechanisms:

---
A. **802.1X enforcement**
- Forescout acts as RADIUS server or RADIUS proxy.
- Uses dynamic VLAN assignment, downloadable ACLs (dACLs), or switch-based role attributes.
- Enforcement happens entirely on the switch’s control plane.
- Device authentication failures or posture failures result in VLAN changes, ACL application, or port bounce.

---
B. **MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB)**
- Used for non-802.1X or headless devices.
- Forescout evaluates MAC-based identity and pushes enforcement instructions to switches using RADIUS.
- Same enforcement tools apply: VLANs, ACLs, roles.

---
C. **SNMP-based port enforcement**
- Used when 802.1X is not feasible or during phased deployments.
- Forescout issues SNMP Set commands to switches to:
  - Shut/no-shut a port.
  - Move a port to a remediation VLAN.
  - Apply a port ACL.

---
D. **Inline firewalls / segmentation gateways**
- Forescout can push dynamic segmentation rules to firewalls, NAC gateways, and micro-segmentation platforms.
- Integration points include: Palo Alto, Fortinet, Check Point, Cisco ISE pxGrid, etc.
- Enforcement occurs at the firewall, not on the Forescout device.

---
E. **Switch API / SDN Controllers**
- Modern networks use API-driven dynamic segmentation.
- Forescout integrates with:
  - Cisco DNAC
  - Aruba ClearPass Extensions
  - Juniper SDN
  - VMware NSX
- Forescout sends commands to SDN controllers to place devices in logical segments.

---
F. **Inline Virtual Appliance (last resort)**
- In rare cases, Forescout can be placed inline for traffic inspection.
- Not common, not recommended at scale, and not the primary design.

---
Summary: Enforcement Happens on the Network Switches

Forescout is fundamentally a *policy decision point* (PDP) and orchestration layer. The actual control plane enforcement—VLAN changes, ACL assignment, port disablement—occurs on:
- Network switches (most important)
- Firewalls
- Wireless controllers
- SDN platforms

This distinction is essential for architectural clarity: **Forescout issues the decision; the switch enforces the decision.**
