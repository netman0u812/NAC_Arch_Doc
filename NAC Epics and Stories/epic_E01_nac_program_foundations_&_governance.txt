Epic Title:
NAC Program Foundations & Governance

Epic Description:
Stand up the governance, scope, standards, and success metrics for the enterprise NAC program, aligning to the architecture: Forescout RADIUS for wired MAB, ISE TACACS for device admin, ISE 802.1X for WLAN, and L3 ACL enforcement at the Cisco core.

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Security Architecture (Michael) + Network Engineering

Business Outcome:
Unified NAC program with clear responsibilities, controls, and measurable outcomes; accelerates time-to-value and reduces deployment risk.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Absence of consolidated governance and repeatable standards increases rollout risk and inconsistency across sites.

Scope:
Policies, standards, change control, environments (lab/pilot/prod), naming conventions, ACL object strategy, golden configs.

Out of Scope (Optional):
Procurement, licensing, site onboarding runbook, RACI, comms plan, training plan not included.

Success Metrics / KPIs:
Signed standard (v1.0); RACI published; risk register created; change approval flow operational; 100% of sites adopt golden templates.

Assumptions:
Executive sponsorship exists; cross-team SMEs available; CAB exists.

Dependencies:
Architecture published; lab gear available; Forescout/ISE credentials and tenant access provisioned.

High‑Level Deliverables:
Program Charter; NAC Standard v1.0; Golden AAA & ACL templates; RACI; Communications & Training outline; Risk Register.

Child User Stories:
S01-01, S01-02, S01-03

Risks & Mitigations:
Schedule slippage due to dependencies; Mitigation: timeboxed workshops, pre-read templates.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
CISO, NetEng, SecOps, Endpoint, Platform, Service Desk, Change Mgmt

Approvals Needed (Optional):
CISO, VP Network, VP Security Ops

Definition of Done:
Charter approved; standard signed-off; templates published in repo; kickoff conducted.

Notes / Additional Context:
NAC currently focuses on admission and maintaining minimum viable state (MVS); least privilege segmentation is later.
