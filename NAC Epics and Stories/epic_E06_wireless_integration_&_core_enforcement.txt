Epic Title:
Wireless Integration & Core Enforcement

Epic Description:
Maintain ISE 802.1X/EAP‑TLS for WLAN; ensure L3 ACLs at Cisco core govern broader network access; correlate WLAN sessions in Forescout for visibility and posture-driven notifications.

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Network Engineering (WLAN) + Security Engineering

Business Outcome:
Preserve mature WLAN identity while centralizing enforcement at routed edges; unified visibility.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Split-brain visibility; inconsistent role-to-network enforcement.

Scope:
WLC/ISE policies, session export to Forescout, L3 ACL mapping.

Out of Scope (Optional):
WLAN guest captive portal (not in scope).

Success Metrics / KPIs:
Correlation rate ≥98%; no change to user auth UX; L3 ACL hits align with WLAN roles.

Assumptions:
Existing ISE WLAN stable.

Dependencies:
E04

High‑Level Deliverables:
Correlation mapping; ACL alignment matrix; validation report.

Child User Stories:
S06-01, S06-02

Risks & Mitigations:
Mapping drift; Mitigation: scheduled audits.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
NetEng WLAN, SecOps

Approvals Needed (Optional):
VP Network

Definition of Done:
Forescout shows WLAN sessions; ACL policy verified at core.

Notes / Additional Context:
No change to 802.1X authorities.
