Epic Title:
Forescout Platform Enablement & RADIUS for Wired MAB

Epic Description:
Deploy and configure Forescout appliances as RADIUS servers (PDP) for wired MAB with dynamic CoA and dACL/VLAN decisions; SNMP used for discovery/guardrails only.

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Security Engineering (Forescout) + Network Engineering

Business Outcome:
Deterministic per-session authorization and rapid posture-driven control changes for managed workstations.

Problem Statement (Optional):
SNMP-only controls are reactive and lack session-level determinism and CoA.

Scope:
RADIUS plugin configuration, MAC repository, CoA (dynamic-author), accounting, health checks, HA pairs, backups.

Out of Scope (Optional):
802.1X/EAP-TLS for WLAN (belongs to ISE); device-admin TACACS+ (belongs to ISE).

Success Metrics / KPIs:
RADIUS auth success rate ≥99.9% in pilot; CoA success ≥99%; accounting completeness ≥99%.

Assumptions:
IP reachability stable; time sync (NTP) across infra; certs where required.

Dependencies:
E01 complete; device credentials; network access; firewall rules opened.

High‑Level Deliverables:
RADIUS profiles; CoA whitelist; Accounting sinks; HA validation; Ops dashboard.

Child User Stories:
S02-01, S02-02, S02-03, S02-04

Risks & Mitigations:
Accounting volume sizing; Mitigation: interim-updates tuned; storage sizing; dashboards.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
SecEng, NetEng, Service Desk, SIEM team

Approvals Needed (Optional):
Security Architecture

Definition of Done:
Pilot switch authenticates via Forescout; CoA works; accounting visible; HA failover tested.

Notes / Additional Context:
Multi-auth supported on access ports.
