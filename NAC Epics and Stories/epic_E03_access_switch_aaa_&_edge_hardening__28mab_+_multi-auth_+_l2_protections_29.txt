Epic Title:
Access Switch AAA & Edge Hardening (MAB + Multi-Auth + L2 Protections)

Epic Description:
Implement switch-side AAA split (ISE TACACS+ vs Forescout RADIUS), per-interface MAB with host-mode multi-auth, and L2 protections (DHCP Snooping, IP Source Guard, DAI).

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Network Engineering

Business Outcome:
Reduce spoofing risk and ensure deterministic authorization at link-up across access layers.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Unhardened edges allow trivial MAC/IP spoofing; inconsistent AAA creates drift and outages.

Scope:
Catalyst 9000/9300/7000/3850/3000 families; golden templates; interface profiles; macros.

Out of Scope (Optional):
Core ACL management; WLAN AAA (handled elsewhere).

Success Metrics / KPIs:
100% of access ports compliant; MAC-move alerts < 0.1% of ports/day; zero auth-related outages in pilot.

Assumptions:
IOS-XE features licensed; access to templates repo.

Dependencies:
E01, E02

High‑Level Deliverables:
AAA server-groups; dynamic-author; interface templates; L2 feature configs; validation scripts.

Child User Stories:
S03-01, S03-02, S03-03, S03-04

Risks & Mitigations:
Legacy switches with feature limits; Mitigation: model matrix and exception path.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
NetEng, SecOps

Approvals Needed (Optional):
VP Network

Definition of Done:
Templates applied; spot checks pass; L2 tables populated; MAC-move alarms operational.

Notes / Additional Context:
Include rate-limits for DHCP; portfast on edges.
