Epic Title:
IoT/OT Device Inventory, Governance & Lifecycle (Adds/Moves/Changes)

Epic Description:
Establish enterprise‑grade governance, inventory, identification, validation, and lifecycle (add/move/change/retire) for IoT and OT devices, leveraging passive discovery (eyeInspect), switch telemetry (DHCP Snooping, SNMP), and structured change workflows aligned to operational safety.

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Security Architecture + OT Engineering + Network Engineering

Business Outcome:
Authoritative, real‑time inventory and safe change management for IoT/OT assets; reduced mean‑time‑to‑know; lower operational risk during device changes; consistent evidence for audits.

Problem Statement (Optional):
IoT/OT governance and inventory processes are ad hoc or absent; new devices appear without validation, increasing safety and cyber risk.

Scope:
• Passive discovery & classification (eyeInspect, DHCP/DNS, SNMP) across Purdue levels.
• Canonical inventory schema (zone, conduit, vendor, model, serial, firmware, safety criticality, process association, owner, support). 
• Identification/validation workflow for unknown devices.
• AMC (add/move/change) process with approvals and MOC (management of change).
• Exception handling for legacy/fragile devices and compensating controls.

Out of Scope (Optional):
Active scanning on fragile OT segments; per‑app microsegmentation (future).

Success Metrics / KPIs:
• 98%+ device coverage in inventory by MAC/IP/zone.
• Unknown‑to‑classified time < 24h for new device events.
• 100% of IoT/OT changes executed via AMC workflow; zero unapproved changes in pilot.

Assumptions:
Passive visibility available (SPAN/TAP); switch DHCP Snooping enabled; stakeholders available (OT, process owners, vendors).

Dependencies:
E01 Governance; E04 Core ACL (for containment); E07 Observability.

High‑Level Deliverables:
Governance policy; canonical inventory schema; discovery runbooks; validation & AMC workflows; exception register; dashboards.

Child User Stories:
S10‑01, S10‑02, S10‑03, S10‑04, S10‑05, S10‑06, S10‑07, S10‑08, S10‑09, S10‑10

Risks & Mitigations:
• Limited OT maintenance windows → stage passive only; pre‑approve change windows.
• Incomplete vendor data → require model/firmware as onboarding gate; conditional access until provided.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
OT Engineering, Process Safety, Network Engineering, SecOps, Vendors, Change Mgmt

Approvals Needed (Optional):
OT Director, Security Architecture, Change Advisory Board

Definition of Done:
Policy approved; inventory coverage ≥98%; AMC workflow live; dashboards operational; first 3 changes executed successfully.

Notes / Additional Context:
Align to Purdue/IEC‑62443 zoning; keep OT passive‑first; use minimum viable controls for containment.
