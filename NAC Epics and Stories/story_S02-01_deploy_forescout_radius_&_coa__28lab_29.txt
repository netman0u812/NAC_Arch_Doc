Draft

Business Outcome:
Enable deterministic admission with minimum viable state, and build toward scalable rollout with observability and auditability.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Without this capability, endpoints may gain excessive access or fail to remediate, increasing risk and support load.

Acceptance Criteria:
• Configuration matches golden templates and passes peer review.
• Functional tests validate success paths and error handling.
• CoA and/or ACL enforcement behaves as designed with evidence captured.
• Dashboards/alerts updated to include this control.

Definition of Done:
• Changes merged to repo with version tag.
• Change ticket executed and closed without Sev1/Sev2 incidents.
• Documentation/runbooks updated.

Notes / Additional Context:
NAC focus is admission + MVS (not least privilege yet). Multi-auth enabled where specified.

Assiocated with Epic:
