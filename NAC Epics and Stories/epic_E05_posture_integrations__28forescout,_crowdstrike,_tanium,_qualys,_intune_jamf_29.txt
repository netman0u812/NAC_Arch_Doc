Epic Title:
Posture Integrations (Forescout, CrowdStrike, Tanium, Qualys, Intune/Jamf)

Epic Description:
Integrate posture sources and define MVS gates: SecureConnector, CrowdStrike health, Tanium online, Qualys agent reporting, Intune/Jamf enrollment & compliance for Windows/macOS.

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Security Engineering (Endpoint/NAC)

Business Outcome:
Ensure only devices meeting minimum viable state gain production access; drive automated remediation.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Unverified endpoints increase risk and incident response overhead.

Scope:
eyeExtend modules, API credentials, connectors, required endpoint attributes, health queries, error handling.

Out of Scope (Optional):
Advanced threat-driven microsegmentation (future).

Success Metrics / KPIs:
False-negative posture <0.5%; posture evaluation <5s median; integration uptime ≥99.5%.

Assumptions:
Endpoint teams support agent baselines; cloud endpoints reachable.

Dependencies:
E02

High‑Level Deliverables:
Integration runbooks; policy elements; test harness; dashboards.

Child User Stories:
S05-01, S05-02, S05-03, S05-04, S05-05

Risks & Mitigations:
API rate limiting/outages; Mitigation: backoff/queueing; cached posture with TTL.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
Endpoint Eng, SecOps, Platform, Identity

Approvals Needed (Optional):
Security Architecture

Definition of Done:
Gates enforced in pilot; telemetry visible; errors alarmed.

Notes / Additional Context:
Windows/macOS parity required.
