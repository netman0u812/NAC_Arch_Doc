Site Readiness Checklist – NAC (Forescout RADIUS for Wired MAB; ISE TACACS; ISE 802.1X WLAN; L3 ACL at Core)
Version: 1.0 | Owner: Security Architecture / Network Engineering

SECTION A — Governance & Contacts
[ ] Program Charter approved (E01)
[ ] Site technical owner(s) identified: NetEng, SecOps, Endpoint, Service Desk
[ ] Change Management contact + CAB cycle confirmed
[ ] Emergency/break‑glass contacts documented

SECTION B — Network Prerequisites (Per Site)
B1. Device Inventory & Versions
[ ] Access switch models & count: Catalyst 9000/9300/7000/3850/3000
[ ] IOS‑XE versions recorded and validated against feature matrix (CoA, DHCP Snooping, IPSG, DAI, multi‑auth)
[ ] Cisco L3 core device identified for ACL enforcement; SVI/VRF topology documented

B2. AAA & Connectivity
[ ] RADIUS (auth 1812/acct 1813) from access VLANs to Forescout RADIUS IPs permitted
[ ] Dynamic‑Author (CoA UDP/3799) from Forescout to access switches permitted
[ ] TACACS+ to ISE for device admin (SSH/console/web) confirmed
[ ] Time sync (NTP) consistent across infra (Forescout/ISE/switches)

B3. Telemetry & Management
[ ] SNMP (161/162) from Forescout to switches permitted (RW scope documented)
[ ] Syslog from switches to SIEM/collector permitted (UDP/TCP 514 or 6514)
[ ] HTTPS/API egress to required cloud services (CrowdStrike, Intune/Jamf, Qualys/Tenable) allowed
[ ] DHCP/Syslog export path defined (if used for lease events)

B4. Edge Security
[ ] DHCP Snooping configured (trusted uplinks defined; VLANs enabled)
[ ] IP Source Guard enabled on access ports; bindings verified
[ ] Dynamic ARP Inspection enabled on relevant VLANs; rate‑limits as needed
[ ] Host‑mode set to multi‑auth on target ports (pilot subset first)

SECTION C — Forescout Platform Readiness
[ ] RADIUS plugin enabled; client definitions; shared secrets
[ ] Dynamic‑Author (CoA) whitelist configured; test CoA success
[ ] RADIUS accounting sinks defined (proxy/collector/SIEM)
[ ] HA pairs validated; backup/restore tested
[ ] Posture integrations reachable (SecureConnector, CrowdStrike, Tanium, Qualys, Intune/Jamf)

SECTION D — ISE / WLAN Readiness
[ ] ISE TACACS Device Admin service healthy
[ ] WLAN (802.1X/EAP‑TLS) unchanged; monitoring in place

SECTION E — Core L3 ACL (MVS) Readiness
[ ] ACL‑MVS created with remediation services (DNS/DHCP/NTP/PKI/Forescout/EDR/MDM/VM/Patching)
[ ] Object groups (FQDN/IP sets) prepared for cloud endpoints
[ ] Pilot VLANs/SVIs selected; attachment plan and rollback documented

SECTION F — Endpoint Readiness
[ ] Managed workstation test set (Windows/macOS) with SecureConnector, CrowdStrike, Tanium, Qualys
[ ] Enrolled in Intune (Windows) or Jamf (macOS)
[ ] Known non‑compliant test cases prepared (agent off/tamper/un‑enrolled)

SECTION G — Lab/Pilot & Rollback
[ ] Lab validation passed (AAA split, MAB auth, CoA, ACL‑MVS, posture gates)
[ ] Pilot change tickets approved; communication plan sent
[ ] Backout procedure documented (disable dACL/apply permissive ACL, revert RADIUS group, local method‑list)

SECTION H — Acceptance Validation (Per Site)
[ ] MAB success rate ≥99.9% on pilot ports
[ ] CoA success rate ≥99%
[ ] RADIUS accounting completeness ≥99%
[ ] No Sev1/Sev2 incidents during pilot window
[ ] Remediation flows (MVS) succeed for all test scenarios

Notes:
• Current scope = admission + MVS. Least‑privilege segmentation is deferred.
