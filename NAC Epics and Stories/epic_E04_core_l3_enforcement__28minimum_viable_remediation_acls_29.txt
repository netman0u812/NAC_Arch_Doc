Epic Title:
Core L3 Enforcement (Minimum Viable Remediation ACLs)

Epic Description:
Define and implement core L3 ACLs that restrict non-compliant endpoints to minimal services for remediation, applied to the Cisco L3 device; maintain objects/FQDN sets for cloud endpoints (EDR/MDM/VM).

Creator:
Martin, Michael J

Status:
Draft

Owner:
Network Engineering + Security Engineering

Business Outcome:
Contain risk while allowing remediation services; no isolation VLAN required.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Overly permissive fallback leads to lateral risk; dedicated isolation VLAN not present.

Scope:
ACL-MVS definitions; service objects; attachment to routed SVIs/VRFs; logging; change windows.

Out of Scope (Optional):
Per-app microsegmentation (future phase).

Success Metrics / KPIs:
<1% ACL hit anomalies; successful remediation reachability ≥99%; zero business-impacting false blocks in pilot.

Assumptions:
Core can host ACL/FQDN objects or accepted static CIDRs for external services.

Dependencies:
E01, E02

High‑Level Deliverables:
ACL-MVS; object groups; deployment plan; rollback plan; logs to SIEM.

Child User Stories:
S04-01, S04-02, S04-03

Risks & Mitigations:
Cloud egress IP drift; Mitigation: FQDN objects/automation; monitoring.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
NetEng, SecOps, Endpoint, Service Desk

Approvals Needed (Optional):
Change Advisory Board

Definition of Done:
ACL enforced on pilot VLANs; logs verified; remediation workflows succeed.

Notes / Additional Context:
Golden object set shared with access dACLs to reduce drift.
