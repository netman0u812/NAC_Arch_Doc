Access Control (AC-3, AC-17): NAC enforces access policies ensuring only authorized devices/users can connect. / NAC enforces identity-based and role-based access policies.

Identification and Authentication (IA-2): NAC integrates with identity systems to verify device/user credentials. / Integration with identity providers (IdPs) for adaptive access.

System and Communications Protection (SC-7): NAC helps isolate and control traffic between network segments. 

Audit and Accountability (AU-2, AU-12): NAC logs access attempts and device behavior for auditing. 

Configuration Management (CM-7): NAC ensures devices meet baseline configurations before access is granted. / Require endpoint compliance checks before granting access. / Helps mitigate risks by preventing non-compliant or vulnerable devices from connecting.

Enforcing authentication protocols. 

Restricting unauthorized device access. / Support for phishing-resistant MFA, Just-In-Time (JIT) access, and role-based access control (RBAC).

Tracking user activity across the network / Providing visibility into network activity. / Assign network access based on user roles and least privilege principles.

Ensuring only compliant devices access sensitive systems. / Ensures only authorized users and devices can access network resources. / NAC continuously monitors device compliance and network activity.

Segmenting of managed,  guest and contractor access  / Supporting data protection through segmentation and authentication

Supporting audit trails for access events

Enforcing device-level access policies. / Dynamic access policies based on identity and device posture

NAC evaluates the security posture of devices before granting access.

NAC provides visibility into all connected devices.

Helps maintain an accurate inventory of assets, including BYOD and IoT.

NAC detects anomalous behavior and unauthorized access attempts.

Facilitates rapid response and containment of security incidents.


Only approved people and devices can connect to the network based on who they are and their role.

Before allowing access, the system checks your identity using trusted login systems.

The network is divided into zones so different users only access what they need.

All connection attempts and device actions are recorded for future review.

Devices must meet safety standards like having antivirus and updates before connecting.

The system checks login details to confirm identity before allowing access.

Only trusted devices and users are allowed, using strong login methods and temporary access when needed.

The system watches what users and devices do on the network and limits access based on roles.

Only safe and approved devices can access sensitive parts of the network, and they are constantly monitored.

Different types of users like guests and employees get access to different parts of the network.

The system keeps a history of who accessed what and when.

Access rules change depending on who you are and the condition of your device.

The system checks if a device is safe before letting it connect.

Shows all devices currently connected to the network.

Keeps a list of all devices including personal and smart devices.

Spots unusual behavior and blocks suspicious devices.

Helps quickly respond to and fix security problems.
